**Summary**<br> This section describes the model training and testing stategy, along with supplementary results not included in manuscdript publications.  The Model Training and Testing section contains the following documents/subsections:

**Hyperparameter Tuning** - documents the hyperparamter tuning process and corresponding results <br>
**Model Validation and Generalizability** - strategy for evaluating training final model, including evaluating generalizability to external datasets.  <br>
**Reamde.md** - this document, providing an overview of the Model Training and Testing section of the GreenTweet_MultivariateBiLSTM github repository

**Note:** The material here is supplementary rather than superlative of published methods and results (insert link once published).  Please see the published materials for a comprehensive description of the model training and testing process.
