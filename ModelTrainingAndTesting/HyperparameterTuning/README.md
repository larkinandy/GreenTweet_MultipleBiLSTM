**Summary**<br> Hyperparameter tuning methodology and results are described here.  This secction if comprised of two documents:

**Readme.md** - describes the tuning methodology, including hyperparameters to tune, range of hyperparameter values, evaluation metrics, and selection strategy <br>
**HParamTuning.xls** - Excel tables with select tables and graphs from hyperparamter tuning


**Note:** The material here is supplementary rather than superlative of published methods and results (insert link once published).  Please see the published materials for a comprehensive description of the model training and testing process.
