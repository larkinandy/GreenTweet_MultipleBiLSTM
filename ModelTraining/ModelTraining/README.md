**Summary**<br> This folder contains the scripts for training models once hyperparameters are fixed.  

[**ModelTraining_FixedParams.ipynb**](./ModelTraining_FixedParams.ipynb) - notebook for training and saving models with the chosen hyperparamters.  <br>
[**GT_Model**](./GT_Model) - metadata and weights of final model, saved as tensorflow objects.  **NOTE:** this folder won't be available until the corresponding manuscript is published <br>
**Reamde.md** - this document, providing an overview of the Model Training process once hyperparameters are fixed

**Note:** The material here is supplementary rather than superlative of published methods and results (insert link once published).  Please see the published materials for a comprehensive description of the model training and testing process.
